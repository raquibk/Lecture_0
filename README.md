# Website
<NEXT UPDATE: 20th June, 2020>
Hello fellow Git Users! This repository encapsulates the making of my website from scratch, using HTML, CSS, BootStrap, Java, Django.
My current website rendition uses HTML, CSS but I intend to use the others in later versions of my website, as I learn it. It is my goal
to make this website entirely by myself, without the use of any web making applications, or any images, graphics, or pieces of writing
found online. I would like this website to be my creative escape; a place where I apply all the subtle skills I have learnt without any
boundaries, and I welcome you to join me on this journey!
I openly welcome any suggestions made by anyone, on how to design my website better, how to code more efficiently, or fixing any possible
bugs. I believe in a fair game, and I will always acknowledge your contributions by referring your username and giving you credit for any
suggestion of yours which I may have applied. Here is a short desciption of the files (and folder) in this repository:

1. Resources (Folder): As suggested by project collaborater,Bhavnoor Kaur, I made' Resources' and moved all the images, graphics, stylesheets
                       which I used for my HTML code into this folder. This made my code look significantly more organized, as every graphic/
                       stylesheet used in my html code is now neatly linked only to files in one folder.

2. website.html: The first rendition of my website. As it is my first real application of code, this rendition of my website, albeit unorgan-
                 ized, shabby and unaesthetic; represents a stepping stone for me. It is made purely using HTML and CSS, without any library,
                 or SCSS extension as I never knew how to use those until today.I will keep every rendition of my website on the repository for
                 you and me to track the improvements I make on my website. 
                 
3. styles.css: The stylesheet used for website.html.

4. webrend2.html: The rendition which I am currently working on. I plan to incorporate bootstrap on the master branch, and further style it
                  using Sass in the ftrfill branch soon.
